	<div class="bio">
		<p>Hello! I wanted to give you some insight on a bit more of what this whole thing is and why I decided to create it. 
		I have been going to Purdue for a year and a half now, and I noticed that we do not have a place where students can come together 
		to exchange things, unlike many other colleges. I think something like this can be very important for giving students a way to find college and life essentials
		without having to spend a fortune doing so. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy shopping, but not so much the spending a lot of moeny part. It adds up after a while and I do not have much money to give out as of right now.
		That's why I created BTU and I hope that it can be as helpful to you as I imagined it to be!
